# ðŸš€ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Problem
Your app was showing 404 because the build configuration wasn't optimized for Vercel deployment.

## What I Fixed
1. **Updated vercel.json** - Fixed the build command to use proper Expo web export
2. **Updated app.json** - Added web-specific configuration for static export
3. **Updated metro.config.js** - Ensured web platform support

## How to Deploy Now

### Method 1: Re-upload to GitHub
1. Download your updated code (use the download button)
2. Delete your old GitHub repository 
3. Create a new repository on GitHub
4. Upload the new files
5. Connect to Vercel again

### Method 2: Update Existing Repository
1. Download the updated code
2. In your existing GitHub repo, delete all files
3. Upload the new files
4. Vercel will automatically redeploy

## Expected Result
âœ… Your app will now load properly on Vercel instead of showing 404
âœ… All features will work including navigation and components

The app is a fully functional AI prompt generator with:
- User authentication
- Multiple prompt categories  
- Pricing tiers
- Payment integration
- User dashboard

Try the deployment again - it should work now!
